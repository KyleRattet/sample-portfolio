        <h2>Upon graduating from the University of Colorado Boulder with a degree in Economics and Minor in Business, Kyle opted to remain in the beautiful state of Colorado, rather than return to his native Southern Californian roots. Kyle spent the next nine years cultivating his finance and business acumen in Downtown Denver as an equity trader and analyst for a New York based hedge fund. While in this role, Kyle furthered his understanding of investing in public equities, global economies, and individual company valuations. Despite his innate passion for markets and investing, Kyle found his interest shifting towards the technologies and software he used on a daily basis to execute trades and manage the portfolio, and away from the investing fundamentals side of the business. Couple this shift in personal curiosity with an undeniable underlying industry trend towards utilizing more computer driven algorithmic trading software and automated portfolio management, Kyle decided to check out under the hood of the software and strategies he used daily. Upon peering into this black box, Kyle realized the real power of becoming a software developer and started allocating time outside of work hacking on code.<br><br>Kyle concluded, after a few months of self-study, he needed an official developer sherpa to guide him in his quest to become a skilled developer, at which point he enrolled in Galvanizeâ€™s immersive Full-Stack (MEAN) program. Throughout this program, Kyle has worked with, and developed core competencies in the following technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, AngularJS, Express, jQuery, Mocha/Chai/Jasmine testing, and more. Upon completion of his program, Kyle looks forward to applying his unique combination of  Full-Stack skills, passion for developing, and business experience  to becoming an integral member of a productive developer team and company.<br><br>Outside of work, you can find Kyle enjoying skiing, golfing, fishing, agonizing over his favorite sports teams, and investing.</h2>
